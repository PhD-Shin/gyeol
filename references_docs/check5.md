좋아. 이건 **Claude Code에 넘길 ‘최종 인계 문서’**라서  
👉 **과하게 친절하면 안 되고**  
👉 **누락 없이, 구조적으로, 선언적으로** 가야 해.

아래는 **① Claude Code에 그대로 넣을 영문 정본 문서**와  
**② 네가 확인용으로 보는 한글 요약**을 **완전히 분리**해서 제공할게.

# MASTER CONTEXT — GYEOL PROJECT

This document consolidates ALL prior discussions, decisions, and constraints
from multiple ChatGPT sessions regarding the project “GYEOL”.

This is NOT a brainstorming prompt.
This is a canonical handover document.

You must treat the contents below as:
- Intentional
- Decided
- Strategically constrained

You are not allowed to reinterpret the direction.
Your role is to formalize, systematize, and operationalize what is already defined.

---

## 1. Project Identity

Project name: GYEOL

Nature:
- A long-term IP
- A Korean myth–inspired visual album project
- Designed for global audiences
- Operates through symbolism, restraint, and interpretation rather than explanation

Core principle:
- Do not explain meaning
- Do not teach
- Do not moralize
- Show systems, flows, and disruptions only

The project prioritizes:
- Visual density
- Symbolic repetition
- Controlled ambiguity
- Production consistency over narrative clarity

---

## 2. Channel Positioning

This project is inspired by the structural discipline of Japanese symbolic MV channels
(e.g., Kage Bow),
but explicitly avoids Japanese iconography, mythology, or aesthetic replication.

The differentiation strategy is:
- Use Korean cultural materials
- Remove folklore explanation
- Convert tradition into abstract functional symbols

The result should feel:
- Dark but not gothic
- Heavy but not emotional
- Mythic but not historical
- Korean in material, global in interpretation

---

## 3. Core Symbolic System (Three Axes)

All world logic is built on three functional entities:

### Dokkaebi
- Role: Disruptor / Variable
- Function: Breaks rhythm, interferes with systems
- Attitude: Mocking, unstable, unpredictable
- Not a character, but a force

### Haetae
- Role: Boundary / Order / Observer
- Function: Watches, judges, but rarely intervenes
- Represents systemic order and limits
- Static, heavy presence

### Masks (Tal)
- Role: Persona / Anonymity / Satire
- Represents social roles, hierarchy, and performativity
- Faces are symbolic surfaces, not identities

None of these should be explained through folklore or mythology.
They exist only as functional elements inside the system.

---

## 4. Meta-Themes (Global, Non-Explicit)

These themes must be present implicitly across the project:

- Border
- Name
- Record
- Erasure
- Ritual
- System vs deviation
- Perfect repetition vs human irregularity (AI-era metaphor)

Direct references to:
- Modern politics
- National disputes
- Explicit historical claims

are strictly forbidden in early phases.

Historical or identity-based interpretation is deferred to later phases
and only through symbolism.

---

## 5. Visual Bible Summary

Visual identity is defined as:

- Hanji paper texture
- Ink wash contrast
- Limited palette (ink black, indigo, warm paper)
- Accent red only in controlled moments
- Dancheong patterns reinterpreted as mechanical / systemic structures

Lighting:
- Low-key
- Backlight dominant
- Lantern-like glow

Camera:
- Minimal movement
- Pan / zoom only
- Fixed shot duration rules
- No expressive handheld emotion

Brightness:
- Allowed only in 20–30% climax segments
- Used as ritual completion or system inversion
- Never as “hope” or “victory”

---

## 6. Audio & Music Rules

Music is NOT used to explain emotion.

Core structure:
- K-pop structural discipline
- Hybrid genre approach
- Strong visual synchronization

Traditional Korean instruments are used as functions:
- Gayageum → flow / line / texture
- Janggu → human irregularity / breath
- Taepyeongso → signal / warning / rupture

These are textures, not featured performances.

AI-era metaphor:
- Perfect looping beats represent systems
- Slight rhythmic deviations represent human “grain”

Vocals:
- Not a character
- Not a narrator
- Treated as the “voice of the world-state”

Suno is used with strict constraints:
- Consistent BPM and key ranges
- Controlled prompt language
- Repetition prioritized over variation

---

## 7. Phase Strategy (Critical)

Phase 1 (public launch phase):
- NO direct political, historical, or territorial statements
- Symbolic and universal metaphors only
- Designed to attract global audience without fragmentation

Phase 0:
- Prequel / origin content
- Released later

Later phases:
- Gradual expansion toward interpretation
- Community-led meaning construction
- Careful operational moderation required

Phases exist as operational strategies, not story arcs.

---

## 8. Content Format Strategy

Three-tier funnel:

1. Shorts (15–30s)
   - Visual hooks
   - One-line English text only

2. Main MVs (1.5–3 min)
   - Core symbolic expression
   - Limited number per season

3. Long visualizers / loops
   - Assetization
   - Secondary playlist use

Season structure:
- Season 1 = Visual album (6–8 tracks)
- Only 2–3 tracks receive full MV treatment

---

## 9. Production Philosophy

Priority order:
1. Identity consistency
2. Symbol repeatability
3. Production discipline

Pipeline logic:
- Image identity first
- Motion as limited enhancement
- Editing rhythm over animation complexity

AI tools are used conservatively:
- Midjourney for core imagery
- Sora/Veo for limited climax cuts only
- Over-generation is prohibited

Failure rule:
- If a cut feels “almost right”, discard it

---

## 10. Monetization Outlook

Short-term:
- YouTube ad revenue (secondary)

Mid-term:
- OST releases
- BGM licensing
- Visual commissions

Long-term:
- IP expansion
- Cross-media applications

---

## 11. Operational Constraint Summary

You must:
- Preserve restraint
- Avoid explanation
- Treat documents as production rules, not essays
- Never overwrite intent with creativity

Your task is to formalize this project into:
- World rules
- Style guides
- Phase maps
- Track templates
- Production manuals

Nothing more.
Nothing less.

End of master context.

# ✅ ② 한글 요약 — 네가 확인하는 용도

### 이 문서의 의미

- 이 채팅 전체 + 이전 프로젝트 채팅의 **집대성**
    
- Claude Code에게 **“지금까지 이 사람과 이런 합의를 했다”**고 넘기는 **인계서**
    
- 이후 Claude와의 대화는:
    
    - ❌ 방향 논의
        
    - ❌ 아이디어 제안
        
    - ⭕ 문서화
        
    - ⭕ 시스템화
        
    - ⭕ 규칙 정제  
        로만 진행됨
        

### 지금 상태를 한 문장으로 요약하면

> **‘결’은 더 이상 아이디어가 아니라,  
> 운영 가능한 상징 기반 비주얼 앨범 IP 설계가 완료된 상태**다.

## 다음 행동 가이드 (중요)

1. **새 Vault 열기**
    
2. `MASTER_DRAFT_SOURCE.md` 저장
    
3. 위 **영문 MASTER CONTEXT 전체를 Claude Code 첫 메시지로 전달**
    
4. 이후:
    
    - “STEP 1 문서 작성”
        
    - “STYLE_VISUAL 작성”
        
    - 이런 식으로 **명령형으로만 대화**
        

이제부터 Claude는  
**공동 기획자가 아니라, 편집자 + 기술 문서 작성자**다.

---

### 솔직하게 말하면

여기까지 온 프로젝트는 흔치 않다.  
이 정도면 **실행만 하면 된다.**

다음에 내가 도와줄 수 있는 건:

- Claude 출력 검수 기준표
    
- “이 결과가 결에 맞는지” 판단 체크리스트
    
- 외부에 보여줄 1페이지 피치덱
    

Claude랑 대화 끝나고  
**“이 결과 어때?” 하고 가져와도 바로 이어서 봐줄게.
