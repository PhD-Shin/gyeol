# MASTER CONTEXT — GYEOL PROJECT

This document consolidates ALL prior discussions, decisions, and constraints
from multiple ChatGPT sessions regarding the project “GYEOL”.

This is NOT a brainstorming prompt.
This is a canonical handover document.

You must treat the contents below as:
- Intentional
- Decided
- Strategically constrained

You are not allowed to reinterpret the direction.
Your role is to formalize, systematize, and operationalize what is already defined.

---

## 1. Project Identity

Project name: GYEOL (결)

Channel name: 결

Nature:
- A long-term IP
- A Korean myth–inspired visual album project
- Designed for global audiences
- Operates through symbolism, restraint, and interpretation rather than explanation

Core principle:
- Do not explain meaning
- Do not teach
- Do not moralize
- Show systems, flows, and disruptions only

The project prioritizes:
- Visual density
- Symbolic repetition
- Controlled ambiguity
- Production consistency over narrative clarity

### Why "결" (GYEOL)

The word "결" in Korean:
- Not heavy
- Neither bright nor dark
- Carries only form, flow, and direction — before emotion attaches

This allows the channel to:
- Stay open through style and movement
- Avoid closing into darkness
- Function as a proper noun globally (no translation needed)

Fixed tagline:
> 이곳은 이야기를 설명하지 않는다.
> 우리는 결을 남긴다.

(English: We do not explain stories. We leave 결.)

---

## 2. Channel Positioning

This project is inspired by the structural discipline of Japanese symbolic MV channels
(e.g., Kage Bow),
but explicitly avoids Japanese iconography, mythology, or aesthetic replication.

The differentiation strategy is:
- Use Korean cultural materials
- Remove folklore explanation
- Convert tradition into abstract functional symbols

The result should feel:
- Cool and dry, not dark
- Stylish, not emotional
- Mythic but not historical
- Korean in material, global in interpretation

Tone priority:
- Not "sad" — closer to "cool"
- Emotion delivered only through visual direction
- Minimal, never melodramatic

### Relationship to Kage Bow

| Element | Kage Bow | 결 |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Center | Shape of shadow | Direction of flow |
| Tone | Cool / Stylish | Cool / Stylish |
| Emotion | Minimized | Minimized |
| Interpretation | Delegated to fans | Delegated to fans |

결 is the Korean-language cousin of Kage Bow.

## 3. World Concept

### Core Philosophy

> **모든 것은 '결'을 따라 움직인다.**
> (Everything moves along its 결.)

In this world, what matters is not:
- Good vs evil
- Win vs lose
- Truth vs lie

What matters is:
**Which direction was it flowing?**

That flow is called **결**.

### World Rules

- 결 is invisible
- But every movement has a 결
- 결 is not forced — each follows their own

In this world:
- There is no right choice ❌
- There is no wrong choice ❌
- Only different 결s exist

### Characters in This World

Characters are:
- Not heroes
- Not tragic protagonists

They are simply **beings who follow their own 결**.

Therefore they:
- Fight
- Leave
- Turn away

Reasons are never explained.
결 is not something you explain.

### World Atmosphere

The world of 결 is:
- Not dark
- Not bright
- Hovering somewhere between light and shadow

It leaves only **form and rhythm**, never explaining emotion.

It does not:
- Speak of sadness
- Shout anger
- Force hope

Instead, the screen shows:
- Movement that pauses, then flows again
- Lines that break, then reconnect
- Shapes that appear briefly, then vanish

This world does not speak. It only shows.

### Time and Space

Time in this world is not linear.

Past, present, and future are not distinguished.
Scenes always begin **in the middle of movement**.

- A fight already started
- A direction already chosen
- A point of no return already passed

The audience witnesses not the reason,
but only **the 결 of the process**.

### What This World Does Not Say

결 does not speak of:
- Lessons
- Critique of the era
- Correct answers
- Conclusions of messages

Yet ironically,
this is why the world **touches the era most closely**.

An era where paths have vanished,
where correct answers have become meaningless,
where action precedes explanation.

결 does not say this —
it simply **already moves that way**.

### Channel Attitude (Core)

This channel does not ask.
Does not explain.
Does not try to convince.

It only leaves one thing:

> **Each one's 결.**

The viewer may:
- Follow this 결
- Deviate from it
- Feel nothing at all

That choice is also a 결.

### Canonical World Statements

- 이곳은 이야기를 설명하지 않는다. 결만 남긴다.
  (This place does not explain stories. It only leaves 결.)
- 우리는 옳은 길을 보여주지 않는다. 각자의 결을 지나갈 뿐이다.
  (We do not show the right path. We only pass through each one's 결.)
- 이유는 없다. 방향만 있다.
  (There is no reason. Only direction.)

### World Summary

> **결 is not a world of darkness,
> but a world before meaning.
> Before speech, before judgment,
> a world where movement exists first.**

---

## 4. Core Symbolic System (Three Axes)

All world logic is built on three functional entities:

### Dokkaebi
- Role: Disruptor / Variable
- Function: Breaks rhythm, interferes with systems
- Attitude: Mocking, unstable, unpredictable
- Not a character, but a force

### Haetae
- Role: Boundary / Order / Observer
- Function: Watches, judges, but rarely intervenes
- Represents systemic order and limits
- Static, heavy presence

### Masks (Tal)
- Role: Persona / Anonymity / Satire
- Represents social roles, hierarchy, and performativity
- Faces are symbolic surfaces, not identities

None of these should be explained through folklore or mythology.
They exist only as functional elements inside the system.

---

## 5. Meta-Themes (Global, Non-Explicit)

These themes must be present implicitly across the project:

- Border
- Name
- Record
- Erasure
- Ritual
- System vs deviation
- Perfect repetition vs human irregularity (AI-era metaphor)

Direct references to:
- Modern politics
- National disputes
- Explicit historical claims

are strictly forbidden in early phases.

Historical or identity-based interpretation is deferred to later phases
and only through symbolism.

---

## 6. Direction of Expression (연출 결)

### Universal Rules (All Phases)

결 does not explain. Therefore, all phases maintain:
- No narration ❌
- No world-building text ❌
- No emotional excess ❌
- No lesson delivery ❌

Instead, speak only through:
- Movement
- Direction
- Rhythm
- Repetition and deviation

### Camera & Editing

- Camera does NOT always follow the subject
- Subject may exit frame; camera stays still
- Cuts are based on **rhythm units**, not meaning units

### Color & Light

- No stark black-white contrast ❌
- Mid-tones dominant (grey, desaturated colors)
- Light does not illuminate subjects — it **passes through**

### Movement

- Actions need not complete
- Emphasize **before and after** the moment of impact, not the impact itself
- Mix slow motion + fast cuts

---

## 7. Narrative Flow (스토리 결)

### Basic Structure

Not:
- Beginning → Middle → End ❌
- Setup → Conflict → Resolution ❌

Instead:

> **Appearance → Trembling → Direction shift → Disappearance**

Each video is not "one story"
but **a record of passing through one 결**.

### Relationship Between Music and Video

Music does not explain emotion.
Video does not summarize story.

Neither complements nor dominates the other.

Music creates 결.
Video moves along that 결.

Lyrics, if any, remain minimal.
**Rhythm and pronunciation** precede meaning.

---

## 8. Visual Bible Summary

Visual identity is defined as:

- Hanji paper texture
- Ink wash contrast
- Limited palette (ink black, indigo, warm paper)
- Accent red only in controlled moments
- Dancheong patterns reinterpreted as mechanical / systemic structures

Lighting:
- Low-key
- Backlight dominant
- Lantern-like glow

Camera:
- Minimal movement
- Pan / zoom only
- Fixed shot duration rules
- No expressive handheld emotion

Brightness:
- Allowed only in 20–30% climax segments
- Used as ritual completion or system inversion
- Never as “hope” or “victory”

---

## 7. Audio & Music Rules

Music is NOT used to explain emotion.

Core structure:
- K-pop structural discipline
- Hybrid genre approach
- Strong visual synchronization

### Traditional Korean Instruments — Usage Principles

**Critical Rule**: Using traditional instruments "traditionally" = failure.

#### What to Avoid ❌
- Traditional Korean melodic patterns
- Folk atmosphere
- Pansori-style emotional excess

#### Success Formula ⭕
> **Traditional instruments = Texture**
> **K-pop = Structure**
> **AI era = Rhythm and repetition**

#### Instrument Roles

**Gayageum (가야금)**
- Role: Line of 결
- Usage:
  - No melody ❌
  - Repetitive riff ⭕
  - Layer like synth pad
- Feel: Cold and refined

**Janggu (장구)**
- Role: Human breath
- Usage:
  - No traditional rhythmic patterns ❌
  - Layer over trap/drill beats ⭕
- Feel: Alive, imperfect

**Taepyeongso / Piri (태평소/피리)**
- Role: Warning / Signal
- Usage:
  - No long sustained notes
  - Short, piercing samples only
- Feel: Unease, awakening

These three are sufficient.
**Using more = becoming "gugak" (traditional Korean music).**

### "Unique K-pop" Structure

The essence of K-pop is not "Korean music" but:
> **Genre mixing + Strong visuality + Performance-centered structure**

#### Song Structure Template
- Intro (traditional instrument solo)
- Drop 1 (trap/hyperpop)
- Break (near-silence space)
- Drop 2 (vocal shred)
- Ending (only traditional instruments remain)

This is **unique K-pop**, not "gugak fusion."

### AI-Era Message — Indirect Expression

#### What to Avoid ❌
- AI lyrics
- Robot imagery
- Digital text overlays

#### 결 Method ⭕
> Show **the rhythmic difference between human and system**

**In Music:**
- Perfect repeating beat (AI/System)
- Slightly off-beat janggu (Human)

**In Video:**
- Looping actions
- Subtle variations of the same scene
- "Thought it was wrong, but intentionally off"

**Message (unspoken):**
> AI is perfect,
> but we create 결.

Delivered without saying.

### Core Formula

> **Traditional sound = Material**
> **K-pop = Form**
> **AI era = State (shown, not said)**

Vocals:
- Not a character
- Not a narrator
- Treated as the “voice of the world-state”

Suno is used with strict constraints:
- Consistent BPM and key ranges
- Controlled prompt language
- Repetition prioritized over variation

---

## 10. Phase Strategy (Critical)

### Strategic Reordering

Original plan was Phase 1 → 2 → 3.
**Revised**: Launch with Phase A (intervention), release Phase 0 (origin) later.

Reason:
- "World explanation" is less important now than **strong first impression + visual addiction**
- Better for algorithm, fan edits, Shorts virality

### Phase Structure

| Phase | Name | Core Question |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Phase A | 개입 (Intervention) | Does 결 exist? |
| Phase B | 전이 (Transition) | Can 결 change? |
| Phase C | 개척 (Pioneering) | Is 결 created? |
| Phase 0 | 발현 (Emergence) | Where did 결 begin? (Released later as prequel) |

### Phase A — 「개입」 (Main Launch)

> The world of 결 is already running.

Core:
- 결 exists — just show it
- Characters' identities unknown
- Symbols pass by briefly

Visual:
- Cool, dry
- Not aggressive
- Refined

Message (not spoken):
- We are already inside the system
- But we have not become completely identical

### Phase B — 「전이」 (Expansion)

> 결 begins to shift.

Core:
- Same figure follows different 결
- Past and present videos overlap
- World expands slightly

### Phase C — 「개척」 (Declaration)

> Not paths, but directions are made.

Core:
- Most message-heavy phase
- Still does not speak directly

Visual:
- Figures scatter in different directions
- Camera chooses no one

### Phase 0 — 「발현」 (Prequel, Released Later)

> Only shows that 결 exists.

Core:
- Almost no world-building
- Symbols pass through without explanation

### Phase Evolution Principle

Phases are designed to **gradually become more vocal** —
but never speak directly, even at the end.

Phases are operational strategies, not story arcs.

### Track Candidates by Phase

**Phase A (개입)**
- 결 – 흔듦 (Trembling)
- 결 – 균열 (Crack)
- 결 – 틈 (Gap)

**Phase B (전이)**
- 결 – 전이 (Transition)
- 결 – 건너 (Crossing)

**Phase C (개척)**
- 결 – 개척 (Pioneering)
- 결 – 방향 (Direction)

**Phase 0 (발현)**
- 결 – 선 (Line)
- 결 – 흐름 (Flow)
- 결 – 결을 따른다 (Following 결)

## 11. Content Format Strategy

Three-tier funnel:

1. Shorts (15–30s)
   - Visual hooks
   - One-line English text only

2. Main MVs (1.5–3 min)
   - Core symbolic expression
   - Limited number per season

3. Long visualizers / loops
   - Assetization
   - Secondary playlist use

Season structure:
- Season 1 = Visual album (6–8 tracks)
- Only 2–3 tracks receive full MV treatment

---

## 12. Production Philosophy

Priority order:
1. Identity consistency
2. Symbol repeatability
3. Production discipline

Pipeline logic:
- Image identity first
- Motion as limited enhancement
- Editing rhythm over animation complexity

AI tools are used conservatively:
- Midjourney for core imagery
- Sora/Veo for limited climax cuts only
- Over-generation is prohibited

Failure rule:
- If a cut feels “almost right”, discard it

---

## 13. Monetization Outlook

Short-term:
- YouTube ad revenue (secondary)

Mid-term:
- OST releases
- BGM licensing
- Visual commissions

Long-term:
- IP expansion
- Cross-media applications

---

## 14. First Track Design — 결 – 흔듦 (Trembling)

### Why This Track for Launch

Phase A's purpose is singular:

> **"This world is not ordinary"**
> — make this felt without explanation.

Dokkaebi, Hahoe-tal, Haetae are ideal because:
- No clear good/evil
- Strong symbolism
- No narrative requirement

→ **Maximize visual density without compromising 결's world rules**

### Track Identity

**Title**: 결 – 흔듦 (Trembling)

**Message (unspoken)**:
- Whether order existed doesn't matter
- Someone **touched the 결**
- After that, the flow changed — only this fact remains

### Atmosphere & Music Tone

- BPM: Mid-tempo (90–110)
- Genre: Dark pop + Trap + Korean percussion rhythms
- Melody:
  - No clear chorus ❌
  - Repeating riff ⭕
- Vocals:
  - Whispers / samples / word fragments
  - **Pronunciation and breath** over lyrics

> Music is not "the driver of emotion"
> but **the vibration that shakes movement**

### Visual Direction Concept

**Keywords**: Appearance → Intervention → Disappearance

No explanation ❌
No collision ❌
*Brushing past* ⭕

### Entity-Specific Direction

**Hahoe-tal (하회탈) — Faceless Gaze**

Role:
- Face where emotion cannot be fixed
- Unknown if smiling or mocking

Direction:
- No direct frontal gaze ❌
- Always at half-angle
- Never fully inside frame
- Appears only at cut endings, then vanishes

→ *Leave only the feeling "someone is watching"*

**Dokkaebi (도깨비) — Variable That Touches 결**

Role:
- Movement that doesn't follow rules
- Action unclear if playful or aggressive

Direction:
- Jump cuts
- Actions off-rhythm
- Induces camera shake

→ *When Dokkaebi appears, screen rhythm breaks*

**Haetae (해태) — Observer Who Doesn't Judge**

Role:
- Does not intervene
- Does not move
- Simply "watches"

Direction:
- Frontal long shot
- Almost no movement
- Only surroundings flow

→ *Appears like a remnant of order*

### Video Structure (Single Track)

**0–20s**
- Empty space
- Wind, cloth, smoke
- Only hints that 결 "exists"

**20–50s**
- Dokkaebi's irregular movement
- Camera rhythm breaks

**50–80s**
- Hahoe-tal appears
- Gazes cross
- Music minimizes

**80–end**
- Haetae appears
- All movement approaches stillness
- Music continues flowing
- **No ending (cuts off mid-scene)**

### Track's Role (Critical)

This first track does NOT:
- Explain world-building ❌
- Introduce characters ❌
- Deliver message ❌

Instead:

> **"This channel is not ordinary MV"**
> — imprint this instantly.

If successful:
- Future tracks need no explanation
- Natural progression to 결 – 균열, 결 – 전이, 결 – 개척

### One-Line Production Standard

> **〈결 – 흔듦〉 uses Korean forms
> not as "tradition" but as "visual variables" —
> an opening declaration.**

---

## 15. Document Set Structure (Production Bible)

### Recommended Storage

- **Obsidian (local)** + **Git (version control)**
- Reason: World/rules undergo constant micro-revisions; change history = asset
- Files: **Markdown + YAML frontmatter** managed like config values

### Document Hierarchy

#### A. Immutable (World Rules)

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `BIBLE_WORLD.md` | World manifesto, 결 definition, prohibitions |
| `STYLE_GUIDE_VISUAL.md` | Palette, lighting, camera, texture rules |
| `STYLE_GUIDE_AUDIO.md` | Instrument principles, K-pop structure, AI-era rules |
| `CHARACTER_BIBLE.md` | Functional definitions (not lore) for Dokkaebi, Haetae, Tal |

#### B. Variable (Operational)

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PHASE_MAP.md` | A/B/C/0 roadmap, KPIs |
| `PHASE_A_LAUNCH.md` | Phase-specific rules, shot ideas, prohibitions |
| `TRACK_TEMPLATE.md` | Per-track production spec |

#### C. Execution (Checklists)

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PIPELINE.md` | Suno → MJ → Sora → Edit workflow |
| `QC_CHECKLIST.md` | Rule violation checks |

### Track Template Structure

Each track file (e.g., `tracks/HEUNDEULM.md`):

```
- Track name: 결 – ○○
- Phase: A/B/C/0
- One-line message (unspoken version)
- Mood keywords (12)
- BPM / genre mix
- Traditional instrument placement (intro/drop/break/outro)
- Suno Prompt v1/v2/v3
- Minimal lyrics (2 chorus lines + hook pronunciation)
- Video concept (20 shot list)
- Character appearance rules
- Cut editing rules (beat-based cut length)
- Thumbnail rule
- Upload metadata (title/hashtags/description)
```

### QC Checklist Items

- Explanation/narration/lesson included? (Y/N)
- Does tradition appear as "introduction"? (Y/N)
- Are characters consumed as over-symbols? (Y/N)
- Is rhythm AI-perfect only? Is there human deviation?
- Is 결's core (direction/flow/deviation) visible?

### AI Collaboration Philosophy

> **This project is not "world built by AI"
> but "world of a human who uses AI."**

Therefore:
- AI = **Speed**
- You = **Direction**
- Obsidian = **Memory**

If this triangle holds,
this is not just a YouTube channel —
it becomes **long-term IP**.

### AI Writing Rules

When using Claude Code or LLMs:

1. Create only skeleton in Obsidian
2. Give AI **role + constraints** (e.g., "You are 결 project's world editor. Do not overturn existing settings. Keep tone Kage Bow-level cool.")
3. Generate **one section at a time**
4. Manually adjust 10–20% of output
5. This ensures world solidifies in **your voice**

---

## 16. Operational Constraint Summary

You must:
- Preserve restraint
- Avoid explanation
- Treat documents as production rules, not essays
- Never overwrite intent with creativity

Your task is to formalize this project into:
- World rules
- Style guides
- Phase maps
- Track templates
- Production manuals

Nothing more.
Nothing less.

---

## Final Summary

> **결 is a channel that does not stack stories,
> but leaves records of passing through directions.**

> **결 uses Korean sound as material,
> moves in K-pop form,
> and shows — without saying — the state of the AI era.**

End of master context.
